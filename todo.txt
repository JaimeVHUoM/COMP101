From Toby:

I've been through all the lab material, and looking at it all in one blob I have to say I think it's all extremely splendid. So well done you.

Thinges (and I've tried to keep as hands-off as possible, else we'll never get the job done. It's all PRETTY

* Has JTL gone through all the labs yet?

* I think we agreed that we will print one big lump will all labs in -- not sure we agreed how far this extends. Is it up to and incl. Desktop2?

* Each chapter has [...can finds this online as ...rpi2.pdf] -- do we want multiple pfds online? Might be confusinge.

rpi1.tex

* I've done some general tidying up and label/ref fixing, and pushed back.

* "Use the up and down cursor keys to move the selection bar to the expand rootfs option, and press Enter. You’ll see a confirmation that ‘Root partition has been resized. The filesystem will be enlarged upon the next reboot’. If that doesn’t mean anything much to you right now, don’t worry, we’ll come back to an explanation of that later (see Section ??). " <-- this section doesn't seem to exist

* Figure 1.3 probably needs replacing. Alas I can't get a photo of the Input Selection switch from this distance.

* The child inherits many of the properties of its parent (you’ll see why this is important in Section ??, <== not sure what this will refer to.

desktop1.tex

* Is this their first login to CS machines? Probably need to explain that their filestore gets mounted from a server here <-- yes

* \item Find Application Blahdeblah. \ref{thingyblobbs}
\item Something else, and when you're done with these <= to fix


* Note to authors: Set up keyboard shortcuts <== wht's this about?

* Incoming IMAP email.manchester.ac.uk
Outgoing SMTP outgoing.manchester.ac.uk
Port SSL
143 STARTTLS 587 STARTTLS
Authentication
Normal password

This is wrong now isn't it?

* Could be link to JTL's ALU tutorial here <-- spose so... 

* Where does backgrounding and nohuping go? <- dunno. I can see & shoud be covered, but nohup should have a one setence pointer if that. 

* What about virtual consoles? This could be a link to JTL's extended [sic] <-- It wouldn't bother me if virtual consoles were not discussed at all.

* 3.6 Terminal stuff
Run some commands in an xterm, including mutt. <- no need. Just say an xtermis what it is -- a console in a little window of its own. 

Sorry -- this is as far as I have got today, and have to go ad do a thing now.

From Graham:

1. page 52,  halfway down the page the paragraph begins: "Type yes (and hit return) in response to the question. You should then be given a command
prompt (you’ll learn more about what this message actually means in COMP??"
An unresolved "??"

2. page 54, section 4.4 a simple web server, second paragraph begins: Start up a terminal, and create a directory called ??
Another "??"

3. p55, 4.4.1, second para, last 3 words: chance it later.
should be "change" not "chance"

4. first bullet point further down the page has another "??": (more help on how to do this in Breakout ??)

5. the last bullet point further down ends with: see the instructions in Appending ??)
Another "??" and I presume "Appending" should be "Appendix"

6. p57, breakout 4.7 is a placeholder, and title spills into text.

7. p58 has two "??"'s
