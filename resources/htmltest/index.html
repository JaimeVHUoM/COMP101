  <h1>Hello world!</h1>
  <p>
     I'm Mr Noodle. I don't exist, but have a name that's conveniently got
     eight letters and starts with an 'm' like other University of Manchester
     users have.

    Here's a picture of me:

    I'm a big fan of cheese. My favourite colour is blue. Here's a picture of some
    cheese in case you don't know whaat that is. I hope you find it helpful.

    The picture came from this page on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cheese_platter.jpg">Wikipedia</a>
    and the nice lady that created it seems happy for it to be reused like this as long as I
    credit her for taking it.
