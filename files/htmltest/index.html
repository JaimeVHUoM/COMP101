  <h1>Hello world!</h1>
  <p>
     I'm Mr Noodle, the imaginary student used in the intro lab notes
     because I have a name that's conveniently got
     eight letters and starts with an 'm' like other University of Manchester
     users.

    Here's a picture of me:

    Please don't confuse me with Mr Noodles noodles, as shown in the picture
    below. These are real noodles, where as I'm an imaginary character and 
    these things aren't the same at all. Other forms of instant noodles are
    available.
